# AVL_tree
Visual representation of AVL tree in C#

The AVL tree is a modification of a binary tree that has the property of balance. The height of the left and right infant's lumbar can not be more than one. The measure of the permitted imbalance is called a balance factor. The equilibrium factor is calculated by removing the height of the left child from the height of the right child. If the equilibrium factor takes the value from the interval [-1,1], then the tree is in allowed imbalance.
If a tree equilibrium is added to adding or removing a node, it is necessary to balance the tree. The tree can balance using the left and right rotation nodes.
